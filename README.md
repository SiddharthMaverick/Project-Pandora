# Project Pandora

**Open Source Software for Molecule Retrosynthesis using Riemannian Flow-Matching (OSS-MRRFM)**

## üåå Project Philosophy

Project Pandora is inspired by the mythological **Pandora‚Äôs Box**, symbolizing hidden possibilities waiting to be discovered. In chemistry, **retrosynthesis** is the process of uncovering the hidden reactants that can form a desired product.

This project combines:

- **Electron/Bond graph representations (Kekul√©-style)**
- **Riemannian Flow-Matching**, a mathematical framework for smooth and constrained transformations
- **Backward generative modeling**, to predict reactants from products while obeying chemical conservation laws

The goal is **educational and research-oriented**, providing an open-source framework to explore **mechanistic retrosynthesis** with chemically valid vector fields.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Backward retrosynthesis**: Predict reactants from a product using a learned Riemannian flow.
- **Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM)**: Moves along a chemically valid manifold instead of naive Euclidean interpolation.
- **Bond‚ÄìElectron (BE) representation**: Ensures electron conservation and valence rules are respected.
- **Toy and real SMILES support**: Run experiments on synthetic toy molecules or small real molecule sets (via RDKit).
- **Modular design**: Easy to extend or integrate new molecule representations or flow matching methods.
- **UNet-based flow prediction (FlowER-style)**: Predicts edge-level bond changes directly from adjacency/electron matrices.

## üì¶ Installation
